Synected enables shortened URL creation on your own blog, using your own domain, removing the dependence on third-party services.

== Description ==

Synected enables shortened URL creation on your own blog. Rather than relying on services such as [tinyurl.com](http://tinyurl.com/) 
or [bit.ly](http://bit.ly/), Synected lets you easily create and use short links based off your own domain. This releases you 
from dependence on a third party — a server error on tinyurl no longer prevents visitors from reaching your site. 
In addition, it strengthens your brand, keeping your domain name in view of your audience even on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) and 
other micro-communication platforms.

Synected is highly configurable, and can be restricted to only certain Wordpress users, or opened to the general 
public. It supports common features, such as optional custom URL names and tracking of URL click counts. No 
.htaccess editing or other advanced installation steps are required; if Wordpress’ “Pretty Permalinks” feature 
works for you, Synected will too, immediately on activation.

Synected is currently in beta.

== Installation ==

Installing Synected is simple and straightforward.

1. Upload the plugin files to a folder named `synected` in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. (If the folder does not exist, create it.)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. (Optional) Follow the full [configuration guide](http://www.blurbia.com/plugins/synected/installation/) detailing all of Synected's options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is Wordpress 2.7 required? =

Synected has been developed and tested only on Wordpress 2.7. In all likelihood, it will work fine on previous 
versions of Wordpress, although the admin screens may not match the formatting well. One of the goals of the 
upcoming 1.0 release is to be tested and fully compatible with versions at least as early as 2.5.

== Screenshots ==

1. The short URL management screen. URLs can be blocked or deleted.
2. Synected settings. Short URLs can be formatted exactly as you need.
3. Create URLs right from the admin panel.
